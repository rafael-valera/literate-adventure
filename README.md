## My free time code experience

The purpose of this repository is only to show what I code in my free time to:
- *learn and discover*
- *have fun*
- *relax*
- *exercise logic*
- *show off to people with no tech knowledge hahaha*

NOTE: I am not a computer scientist or been to tech school, just a hobbist... So you won't see, not yet, 
rocket launching programming.
